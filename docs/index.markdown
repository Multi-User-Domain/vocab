# MUD Base Ontology Specification

## Abstract

This specification describes the base RDF classes and properties of the MUD ontologies. Intended to provide the common terms needed for a Multi User Domain.

Applied to the [MUD Project](https://Multi-User-Domain.github.io/) this ontology describes only the core properites which relate to all types of Multi User Domain and all services.

## MUD Ontology Modules

To make the vocabularies as modular and flexible as possible, other parts of it have been divided into some other ontologies, summarised and linked below:

{% include vocabs-contents.html %}

##Â Status of this Document

The MUD ontologies are in a very early stage of development and subject to a high degree of change. These changes will not be made backwards-compatible until the project is at a more stable point of its development.

TODO: collections of classes and properties, and then for-loop them here, or rather in the vocab template

Make this as a separate repo and use as a dependency or something ? Make it a Jekyll theme ?
